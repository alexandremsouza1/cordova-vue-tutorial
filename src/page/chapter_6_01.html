<p>This is a paragraph element,

<!--浮动图像和负文本缩进-->
<img src="star.jpg"

     float: left" alt="An image of a five-pointed star.">
<p class="hang">This paragraph has a negatively indented first line,which overlaps the floated image that precedes the
  text. Subsequent lines do not overlap the image,since they are not indented in any way</p>

<!--用百分数实现缩进-->
<div>
  <p>This paragraph is contained inside a DIV,which is 400px wide, so the first line of the paragraph is indented 40px
    (400 *10%=40).
    This is because percentages are computed with respect to the width of the element.
  </p>
</div>
<!--缩进继承-->
<div id="outer">
  <div id="inner">
    This first line of the DIV is indented by 50 pixels.
    <p>This paragraph is 200px wide,
      and the first line of the paragraph is indented 50px.
      This is because computed values for 'text-indent' are inherited,instead of the declared values</p>
